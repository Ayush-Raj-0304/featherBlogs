## 🎓 What I Learned

Developing **Feather Blogs** enhanced both my frontend and backend integration expertise. Here’s what I gained:

- **Asynchronous JavaScript Mastery:** Efficiently handled API calls, user sessions, and async form submissions.
- **Redux Toolkit in Production:** Streamlined global state handling with reduced boilerplate and better debugging.
- **Dynamic Form Handling:** Built highly customizable forms with built-in validation using React Hook Form.
- **Rich Content Handling:** Used TinyMCE and HTML Parser to create and safely render user-generated content.
- **Modular Backend Integration:** Worked with Appwrite to abstract backend services like auth, DB, and storage without managing infrastructure.
- **CI/CD and Deployment:** Automated build, preview, and production workflows using Vercel.

This project helped solidify my Frontend fundamentals, sharpened my debugging skills, and gave me a deep understanding of integrating modern SaaS tools into production-ready apps.
